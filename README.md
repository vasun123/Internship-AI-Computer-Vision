Completed AI Facial recognition project as part of 8 week summer Internship in “Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning & Deep learning.” The primary objective of the project was to predict gender by analyzing incoming live video frames and predict the gender of all faces in the video, along with my program’s confidence percentage. This project was coded in Python, based on a Convolutional Neural Network using Keras and OpenCV. Training data was from an external dataset from Kaggle. Used 5 Convolution layers, each using the ReLU activation function; my output layer then uses the Sigmoid function.
